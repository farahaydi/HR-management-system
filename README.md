# HR-management-system

In this project, we will be adding a form that allows users to enter data for employees. The form will collect information such as FullName, Department, Level, and Image. We will then use JavaScript and the DOM to dynamically create employee cards and display the entered data. Additionally, we will include the following features:

>  1. Employee ID: We will generate a random 4-digit number using a specific function and display it on the employee card.

> 2. Salary: We will generate a salary within a specific range and display it on the employee card.
